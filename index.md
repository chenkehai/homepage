## Welcome to Lemao's Homepage

My name is Lemao Liu. I am currently a researcher at NICT, Japan, working on natural language processing, parsing, machine translation and their related areas. You can reach me through lemaoliu@gmail.com.

### More about me

I earned my Ph.D. degree from C.S. Dept. at Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT) in Oct. 2013, under the instructions from Prof. Tiejun Zhao at HIT and Dr. Taro Watanabe at NICT. Before that, I was a postdoc researcher at the City University of New York, working with Prof. Liang Huang.
